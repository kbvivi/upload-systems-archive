This is a repo that archives all of the app themes and effects from shutting down [upload.systems](https://upload.systems)  
## [ðŸ›‘ Info from Developers](https://upload.systems/shutdown)
## What is ShareX/upload.systems
**ShareX** is an app that provides you many useful tools for taking picture, recording or even making gif from screen. It also gives you a way to quickly upload these files to host. And that's what is/was upload.systems for. **Upload.systems** is a service for hosting various types of content including pastes, images, and even link shortening etc. with many fancy features like custom domains for free.

### How did I archive all of the data?
I'm not posting the method of scraping the data from servers until shut down of website to not make it difficult to users backup their files (for example by overloading the servers)

### What have I archived here?
- App themes - `.json` files that contain custom themes for ShareX.
- Effects - Effects are most of the time overlays in `.sxie` format that gonna be added when taking screenshot, for example effect that puts Windows-like window on top of the actual image.
- Authors of these creations - To provide the best quality of archive I also put some simple info about all the creators that made at least one of the above.
- Info about creations - Including but not limiting to likes, downloads, author name etc.  
### ðŸ›‘ I did NOT archive any user outside of this. ðŸ›‘
Including images, pastes, shortened links (that by the way won't work after service shut down) etc. You should backup them yourself **before** time ends. I do not have access to this anyways.
